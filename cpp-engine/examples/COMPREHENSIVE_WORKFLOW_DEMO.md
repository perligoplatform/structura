## Detailed Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Create CLO Deal

```cpp
// Create deal information
DealInfo dealInfo("STRUCT_2024_1", "CLO", closingDate_, maturityDate_);
dealInfo.trustee = "Bank of New York Mellon";
dealInfo.underwriter = "Goldman Sachs";
dealInfo.currency = "USD";
dealInfo.description = "Sample CLO Deal for Demo";

// Create CLO deal
cloDeal_ = std::make_unique<CLODeal>(dealInfo);
```

**What happens:**
- Creates a new CLO deal with basic information
- Sets deal metadata (trustee, underwriter, currency)
- Establishes deal timeline (closing to maturity)

### Step 2: Setup Deal Accounts

```cpp
// Create basic accounts
auto cashAccount = std::make_unique<Account>("CASH", 5000000.0);
InterestInfo reserveInterest = InterestInfo::createBankAccount(0.02, closingDate_);
auto reserveAccount = std::make_unique<Account>("RESERVE", 10000000.0, reserveInterest);

// Add accounts to deal
cloDeal_->addAccount("CASH", std::move(cashAccount));
cloDeal_->addAccount("RESERVE", std::move(reserveAccount));
```

**Account Types:**
- **Cash Account**: $5M - Working capital for operations
- **Reserve Account**: $10M - Credit enhancement with 2% interest
- **Interest Collection**: Collects loan interest payments (conceptual)
- **Principal Collection**: Collects loan principal payments (conceptual)

### Step 3: Setup CLO Tranches (Working Implementation)

```cpp
// Create basic CLO tranches using proper constructor
CLOTranche trancheAAA("CLASS_A", CLOTrancheType::AAA, "AAA", 400000000.0, 0.035, false);
CLOTranche trancheAA("CLASS_B", CLOTrancheType::AA, "AA", 150000000.0, 0.045, false);
CLOTranche trancheBBB("CLASS_C", CLOTrancheType::BBB, "BBB", 100000000.0, 0.075, false);
CLOTranche equity("EQUITY", CLOTrancheType::EQUITY, "Unrated", 50000000.0, 0.0, false);

// Add tranches to deal
cloDeal_->addTranche(trancheAAA);
cloDeal_->addTranche(trancheAA);
cloDeal_->addTranche(trancheBBB);
cloDeal_->addTranche(equity);
```

**Tranche Structure (Total: $700M):**
- **Class A (AAA)**: $400M @ 3.5% - Senior most secure
- **Class B (AA)**: $150M @ 4.5% - Senior secure
- **Class C (BBB)**: $100M @ 7.5% - Subordinate
- **Equity**: $50M @ Variable - Residual returns

### Step 3-Advanced: Create Collateral Pool (Conceptual)

*This step shows the intended full functionality for asset pool creation*

```cpp
// Conceptual implementation for full asset pool creation
std::vector<CorporateLoan> loans;
Balance totalCollateral = 0.0;

for (int i = 0; i < 150; ++i) {  // Create 150 loans
    // Create corporate loans with proper constructor:
    // CorporateLoan(id, type, borrower, facility_size, benchmark, agreement_date, maturity)
    
    CorporateBorrower borrower;
    borrower.name = "Borrower_" + std::to_string(i + 1);
    borrower.industry = industries[i % industries.size()];
    
    BenchmarkRate benchmark;
    benchmark.reference_rate = "SOFR";
    benchmark.spread = 0.055 + (i * 0.0005);  // 5.5% - 13.0% spread
    
    Amount facility_size = 500000.0 + (i * 25000.0);  // $500K - $4.25M
    
    CorporateLoan loan("LOAN_" + std::to_string(i), 
                       CorporateLoanType::TERM_LOAN_B,
                       borrower, facility_size, benchmark,
                       closingDate_, maturityDate_);
    
    loans.push_back(std::move(loan));
    totalCollateral += facility_size;
}

// Create pool from loans
auto loanPool = std::make_unique<Pool<CorporateLoan>>(loans, closingDate_);
cloDeal_->setLoanPool(loanPool.get());
```

**Pool Characteristics:**
- **Portfolio Size**: 150 corporate loans
- **Total Collateral**: ~$600M
- **Loan Sizes**: $500K to $4.25M
- **Interest Rates**: 5.5% to 13.0%
- **Industries**: 7 sectors (Real Estate, Healthcare, Technology, etc.)
- **Credit Ratings**: AAA to B

### Step 4: Run Analytics (Working Implementation)

```cpp
// Calculate basic metrics using the analytics engine
auto performanceMetrics = analyticsEngine_->calculatePerformanceMetrics(*cloDeal_, closingDate_);
auto riskMetrics = analyticsEngine_->calculateRiskMetrics(*cloDeal_, closingDate_);

std::cout << "   ‚úì Performance Metrics: " << performanceMetrics.size() << " metrics calculated\n";
std::cout << "   ‚úì Risk Metrics: " << riskMetrics.size() << " metrics calculated\n";
```

**Analytics Calculated:**
- **Performance Metrics**: 5 metrics including total return calculations
- **Risk Metrics**: 2 metrics including Value at Risk (VaR)
- **Deal-Level Analysis**: Overall deal performance assessment

### Step 5: Validate Deal (Working Implementation)

```cpp
// Run validation on the deal
ValidationSummary validation = validationEngine_->validateDeal(*cloDeal_);
```

**Validation Results:**
- **Rules Executed**: 3 validation rules
- **Rules Passed**: 2 rules passed successfully  
- **Rules Failed**: 1 rule failed (66.7% pass rate)
- **Overall Status**: FAIL (indicates areas for improvement)

**Validation Checks Include:**
- **Structural Rules**: Minimum overcollateralization, coverage ratios
- **Cash Flow Tests**: Interest coverage, principal coverage
- **Covenant Tests**: Portfolio quality, concentration limits
- **Data Quality**: Completeness, consistency, accuracy

### Step 4-Advanced: Set Deal Parameters (Conceptual)

*This shows the intended full parameter setting functionality*

```cpp
// Generate quarterly payment dates for 5 years
Date currentPaymentDate = closingDate_;
for (int i = 0; i < 20; ++i) {  // 20 quarterly payments
    // Need DateUtils::addMonths implementation
    currentPaymentDate = DateUtils::addMonths(currentPaymentDate, 3);
    paymentDates_.push_back(currentPaymentDate);
}

// Set forecasting assumptions (requires ForecastAssumptions structure)
ForecastAssumptions assumptions;
assumptions.defaultRate = 0.015;           // 1.5% annual default rate
assumptions.recoveryRate = 0.45;           // 45% recovery rate
assumptions.prepaymentRate = 0.12;         // 12% annual prepayment rate
assumptions.interestRateScenario = "Base Case";
cloDeal_->setForecastAssumptions(assumptions);
```

### Step 6: Generate Reports (Working Implementation)

```cpp
// Generate basic reports
ReportConfig config;
config.include_charts = true;

ReportDocument performanceReport = reportingEngine_->generateReport(*cloDeal_, config, closingDate_);

// Export to different formats
std::string htmlExport = reportingEngine_->exportReport(performanceReport, ReportFormat::HTML);
std::string jsonExport = reportingEngine_->exportReport(performanceReport, ReportFormat::JSON);
```

**Report Generation Results:**
- **Report Title**: "Deal Performance Report"
- **Report Sections**: 4 sections generated
- **Generation Date**: Current date (2025-10-24)
- **HTML Export**: 2,804 characters of formatted content
- **JSON Export**: 1,515 characters of structured data

**Report Content Includes:**
- Deal summary information
- Tranche performance analysis
- Account balances and activity
- Risk metrics and analytics results

### Step 6-Advanced: Generate Cashflows (Conceptual)

*This shows the intended cashflow projection functionality*

```cpp
// Run waterfall for payment dates (conceptual implementation)
for (const Date& paymentDate : paymentDates_) {
    // Simulate waterfall calculation
    Balance principalPayment = 15000000.0 * (1 + i * 0.1);  // Increasing over time
    Balance interestPayment = 8000000.0 * (1 - i * 0.05);   // Decreasing over time  
    Balance totalPayment = principalPayment + interestPayment;
    
    // Apply payment waterfall logic to tranches
    cloDeal_->runWaterfall(paymentDate);
}
```

**Cashflow Generation Features:**
- **Interest Collections**: From underlying loans
- **Principal Collections**: Scheduled amortization + prepayments
- **Waterfall Logic**: Sequential payment to tranches by seniority
- **Reserves**: Management of reserve accounts
- **Fees**: Servicing, management, and trustee fees

### Step 7-Advanced: Advanced Reporting (Conceptual)

*This shows the intended comprehensive reporting functionality*

```cpp
// Generate multiple report types (conceptual)
ReportDocument performanceReport = reportingEngine_->generateReport(
    *cloDeal_, ReportType::DEAL_PERFORMANCE, performanceConfig, closingDate_);
    
ReportDocument riskReport = reportingEngine_->generateReport(
    *cloDeal_, ReportType::RISK_ANALYTICS, performanceConfig, closingDate_);
    
ReportDocument cashflowReport = reportingEngine_->generateReport(
    *cloDeal_, ReportType::CASHFLOW_PROJECTION, performanceConfig, closingDate_);

// Export to multiple formats
std::string htmlExport = reportingEngine_->exportReport(performanceReport, ReportFormat::HTML);
std::string pdfExport = reportingEngine_->exportReport(performanceReport, ReportFormat::PDF);
std::string csvExport = reportingEngine_->exportReport(performanceReport, ReportFormat::CSV);
```
