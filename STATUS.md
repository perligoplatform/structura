# Structura C++ Engine Development Status

## Current Branch: `feature/missing-asset-types`
**Date**: October 24, 2025

## Overview
The Structura project consists of a mature Haskell financial modeling system (~8,562 lines) and a developing C++ engine. This document tracks the porting effort from Haskell to C++.

## Recent Achievements ‚úÖ

### Deal Structure Implementation (Completed)
- **CLO Deal**: Comprehensive CLO implementation with 7 tranche types, overcollateralization tests, portfolio management
- **Consumer ABS Deal**: Consumer-specific features with 5 tranche types, early amortization triggers, servicing management  
- **Architecture**: Both follow established DealBase patterns with complete waterfall structures and analytics
- **Build System**: CMake integration ready (commented pending Pool template fixes)
- **Tests**: 92/92 tests passing, deal headers compile successfully

### Comprehensive Gap Analysis (Completed)
- **Analyzed**: All 25 Haskell modules vs existing C++ implementation
- **Identified**: Missing ~75% of core financial functionality 
- **Categorized**: Components by priority and dependency relationships
- **Result**: Clear roadmap for systematic porting

## Critical Findings üö®

### Existing C++ Components ‚úÖ
- **Assets**: All major types (Mortgage, CreditCard, AutoLoan, StudentLoan, Lease, etc.)
- **Core**: Basic Types, Account, DealBase, FinancialTypes
- **Deals**: Several structures (BondDeal, LeaseABS, CLO, ConsumerABS)
- **Entities**: Bond, Fee, Deal basic structures

## Dependency Analysis üîó

### Key Dependencies Discovered:
1. **Liability is Foundational**: Imported by Triggers, Validation, Reports, Waterfall
2. **Waterfall Defines Actions**: Action types executed by Triggers via RunActions  
3. **Triggers Orchestrate**: DealRun.hs shows triggers calling waterfall actions
4. **Clear Chain**: Liability ‚Üí Waterfall ‚Üí Triggers ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Reports

### Import Analysis Results:
- **Waterfall.hs** imports: Types, Revolving, Stmt, CreditEnhancement, Hedge, Ledger
- **Triggers.hs** imports: Liability, Waterfall(Action), Accounts  
- **Validation.hs** imports: Waterfall, Liability, CreditEnhancement, Accounts, Expense
- **Reports.hs** imports: Asset, Accounts, CreditEnhancement, Hedge, Expense, Liability

## Development Strategy üí°

### Chunked Implementation Approach:
1. **Small Increments**: Break each component into compilable, testable chunks
2. **Build/Test/Commit**: Ensure each chunk builds and tests pass before proceeding
3. **Iterative Development**: Start with core data structures, then add functionality
4. **Dependency-Aware**: Ensure prerequisites are available before dependent components

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ **Completed**: Deal structures, gap analysis, dependency analysis, roadmap
- üîÑ **In Progress**: Preparing Phase 1 implementation  
- ‚è≥ **Next**: Git workflow (check-in, merge, new branch) ‚Üí Cashflow core data structures

## Technical Notes üìù

### Known Issues:
- **Pool Template Compatibility**: CorporateLoan/ConsumerInstallment need AssetBase inheritance
- **Build Integration**: Deal structures ready but commented in CMakeLists.txt pending fixes

### Architecture Decisions:
- **Maintain Haskell Patterns**: Preserve functional programming concepts where beneficial
- **C++ Best Practices**: Use modern C++17/20 features appropriately  
- **Test-Driven**: Implement comprehensive tests alongside each component
- **Header Organization**: Follow existing patterns in cpp-engine/src structure

## Success Metrics üéØ

### Definition of Done for Phase 1:
- [ ] Cashflow: Core data structures compile and test
- [ ] InterestRate: Basic rate types compile and test  
- [ ] DateUtil: Enhanced utilities compile and integrate
- [ ] Util: Enhanced functions compile and integrate
- [ ] All existing tests (92/92) continue to pass
- [ ] New foundation tests added and passing

### Long-term Goals:
- **Feature Parity**: C++ engine matches Haskell functionality
- **Performance**: C++ implementation provides performance benefits
- **Maintainability**: Clear, well-documented, testable code
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing deal structures
