# What is Hastructure ?

``Hastructure`` names after ``Haskell`` and ``Structured Finance``, aims to provide cashflow projection for deal/transactions described in either Haskell structure or ``JSON`` via RESTful Service, with inputs from below:

* deal components (bonds,assets,accounts,waterfall,trigger,fees etc.) 
* pool performance assumption input as well as interest rate assumption

``Hastructure`` will generate outputs:

* cashflow of bonds/accounts/fees
* pricing of bonds
* or other outputs make your lose money faster :sunglasses:

# Why Hastructure ?

* :bricks: A collection of building blocks to build cashflows model for structured product. User just need to `compose` them together.
* :car: In-house and white-label friendly.
* :flags: No lock-in risk, all JSONs input/output, no proprietary file formats.

# I'm using language XXX

* :snake: [Python wrapper](https://github.com/yellowbean/PyABS) is in ``Beta`` now !
* :coffee: Easy integration with ``Java/C#/C++/JavaScript/Python`` with ``RESTful`` interface and Docker image are ready. 
  * C/Java : [here](https://github.com/absbox/Hastructure/issues/106)

* Misc
  * Support user define pay dates & pool collection dates 


### Online Demo

The demo only cover very limit features of this engine and subject to UI performance issue due to rapid prototype design of web component

**Pls noted that the web demo is far behind latest development/stable version**
